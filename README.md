# Schedulr

An intelligent scheduling system that dynamically orchestrates classes, blocks, and teachers across multiple days, built as a side project to fix my former school's schedules.

For a detailed breakdown of the project, tech stack, features, and credits, see Schedulr's project page [here](https://rsrdev.com/projects/schedulr/).

Built with Next.js and Prisma.
